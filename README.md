# DecentralizedIdentityVault

Welcome to **DecentralizedIdentityVault**, a project aimed at providing a secure, decentralized solution for managing digital identities. This repository implements a vault for storing and managing identity data in a privacy-preserving, user-controlled manner, leveraging blockchain and decentralized technologies.

## Overview

The DecentralizedIdentityVault is designed to empower individuals with self-sovereign identity, allowing them to securely store, manage, and share their identity credentials without relying on centralized authorities. Built with modern cryptographic techniques and decentralized frameworks, this project aims to enhance privacy, security, and interoperability in the digital identity ecosystem.

### Key Features
- **Self-Sovereign Identity**: Users control their identity data without intermediaries.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Identity data is stored securely using blockchain or distributed systems.
- **Privacy-Preserving**: Cryptographic methods ensure data remains confidential and tamper-proof.
- **Interoperability**: Compatible with W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID) and Verifiable Credential standards (assumed based on context).
- **Scalable Design**: Built to handle identity management for individuals and organizations alike.

## Motivation

Centralized identity systems often create single points of failure, exposing users to privacy breaches and data misuse. The DecentralizedIdentityVault addresses these challenges by distributing control back to the user, leveraging decentralized technologies to create a trustless, secure identity management framework.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.x or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package management
- A blockchain environment (e.g., [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/), [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/), or similar) for DID integration *(adjust based on actual tech stack)*
- Git installed for cloning the repository

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rishantster/DecentralizedIdentityVault.git
   cd DecentralizedIdentityVault
   ```
2. Install dependencies:


   ```bash

   npm install

   ```

Or, if using Yarn:

   ```bash

   yarn install

   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory.

Add necessary configurations (e.g., blockchain node URL, private keys—specifics depend on implementation):
plaintext

BLOCKCHAIN_NODE_URL=<your_blockchain_node>
PRIVATE_KEY=<your_private_key>


## Running the Project

Start the application:

```bash

npm start

```

Or, if using Yarn:

```bash

yarn start

```

Access the vault interface (e.g., via a local web server at http://localhost:3000—adjust based on actual setup).

## Usage

- Initialize Identity: Create a new decentralized identifier (DID) for a user.

- Store Credentials: Add verifiable credentials to the vault securely.

- Share Identity: Generate proofs or share credentials with third parties as needed.

- Revoke Access: Manage permissions and revoke access to shared data.

Detailed usage instructions depend on the specific implementation and UI provided in the repo.

## Technology Stack

- Backend: Node.js (assumed—adjust if different)

- Blockchain: Ethereum / Hyperledger (assumed—specify the actual blockchain)

- Standards: W3C DID, Verifiable Credentials (assumed based on context)

- Cryptography: Public-key cryptography (e.g., ECDSA) (assumed—adjust if specific libraries are used)
